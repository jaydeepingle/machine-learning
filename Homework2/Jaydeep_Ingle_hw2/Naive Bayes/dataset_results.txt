Accuracy: 93.7%
Accuracy After filtering stopwords: 91.7%

This part deals with the stopwords filtering
Accuracy may increase or decrease. It depends on the number of stopwords
present in the dataset. If there are no stopwords in the dataset the
accuracy is going to be same. 
Also if training data contains less stopwords and test contains more or vice
versa the accuracy will be either greater or less than the accuracy without
the stopwords
